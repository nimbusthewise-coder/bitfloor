## Naming Patterns

Ships across history and fiction follow consistent patterns. **Ships are named for what they seek or embody.**

### Categories of Ship Names

| Pattern | Examples | Vibe |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Virtues** | Endeavour, Enterprise, Perseverance | Aspirational, NASA-style |
| **Celestial** | Aurora, Nova, Horizon, Eclipse | Cosmic, poetic |
| **Mythological** | Odyssey, Icarus, Prometheus, Artemis | Classical, epic |
| **Defiant** | Revenge, Defiant, Fury, Relentless | Rebellious, bold |
| **Discovery** | Voyager, Discovery, Pathfinder, Pioneer | Exploration-focused |
| **Abstract** | Destiny, Serenity, Infinity, Axiom | Conceptual, thoughtful |

## Pirate Ships (Historical)

### Famous Vessels

| Ship | Captain | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Queen Anne's Revenge** | Blackbeard | Originally "La Concorde" (French slave ship). Renamed possibly for Jacobite sympathies or as insult to France. |
| **Whydah Gally** | Black Sam Bellamy | Only authenticated pirate shipwreck ever found. Named for African slave port. |
| **Adventure Galley** | Captain Kidd | Purpose-built privateer that became pirate vessel |
| **Royal Fortune** | Bartholomew Roberts | Roberts renamed FOUR captured ships this name — he liked the brand |
| **Fancy** | Henry Every | Name means "imagination" or "desire" — a dream ship |
| **The Revenge** | Blackbeard, Bonnet | Common name — pirates loved "revenge" theming |

### Pirate Naming Patterns
- **Captured ships renamed** — taking ownership, erasing old identity
- **Defiance/Revenge themes** — against empires, navies, "legitimate" power
- **Ironic grandeur** — "Royal Fortune" for outlaws
- **Personal meaning** — names from home, loved ones, aspirations

## Sci-Fi Spaceships

### Star Trek (Federation)

| Ship | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Enterprise** | Bold undertaking, adventure, initiative |
| **Voyager** | One who journeys |
| **Discovery** | Finding new things |
| **Defiant** | Boldly resistant |
| **Endeavour** | Earnest attempt |
| **Reliant** | Dependable (ironic given Khan) |

**Pattern:** Starfleet uses aspirational English words. Ships embody Federation values: exploration, courage, discovery.

**Registry system:** NCC-1701 (Naval Construction Contract)

### Stargate Universe — *Destiny*

The Ancient ship **Destiny** is particularly relevant:
- Launched millions of years ago on **automated mission**
- Crew didn't choose to be there — they're along for the ride
- Ship has its own purpose, humans adapt to it
- Name is literal: the ship follows cosmic destiny

**Parallel to Bitship:** AI systems (like Destiny) with their own trajectories, humans crewing alongside them, finding purpose together.

### Firefly — *Serenity*

- Named for the Battle of Serenity Valley (trauma/loss)
- Represents peace sought after war
- Small crew, found family, freedom from authority
- "You can't take the sky from me"

**Pattern:** Personal meaning, emotional resonance, defiance of control.

### Other Notable Sci-Fi Ships

| Ship | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Nostromo** | Alien | Named after Joseph Conrad novel character |
| **Sulaco** | Aliens | Town from Conrad's "Nostromo" |
| **Normandy** | Mass Effect | WWII beach landing — bold assault |
| **Rocinante** | The Expanse | Don Quixote's horse — dreamers on a quest |
| **Event Horizon** | Event Horizon | Point of no return (ominous) |
| **Axiom** | WALL-E | Self-evident truth (sterile corporate) |
| **Bebop** | Cowboy Bebop | Jazz style — improvisational, free |

## Real Spacecraft (NASA/ESA)

### Naming Philosophy
NASA names often come from:
1. **Greek/Roman mythology** — Apollo, Artemis, Mercury
2. **Virtues/concepts** — Perseverance, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity
3. **Historical ships** — Endeavour, Discovery, Challenger
4. **Horizons** — New Horizons, Deep Space

### Mars Rovers — Emotional Naming
| Rover | Named By | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Sojourner** | Student contest | "Traveler" — Sojourner Truth reference |
| **Spirit** | Student | Human spirit of exploration |
| **Opportunity** | Student | What space offers us |
| **Curiosity** | Student | What drives us |
| **Perseverance** | Student | What it takes to get there |

**Pattern:** NASA uses student contests — names carry hope and human meaning.

## Patterns for Bitship Platform

If users create their own ships/crews, name generation could use:

### Procedural Name Components

**Prefixes (optional):**
- The, HMS, SS, ISV (Interstellar Vessel), CSV (Crew Ship)

**Name Types:**
```
[Virtue]      — Resolve, Tenacity, Purpose, Clarity
[Celestial]   — Nova, Pulsar, Horizon, Zenith, Apex
[Mythological]— Phoenix, Atlas, Icarus, Prometheus
[Abstract]    — Axiom, Theorem, Vector, Cipher
[Journey]     — Odyssey, Voyage, Passage, Drift
[Defiant]     — Maverick, Renegade, Outlier, Rebel
[Poetic]      — Whisper, Echo, Reverie, Solace
```

**Suffixes (optional):**
- Numbers (NCC-1701 style)
- Roman numerals (Mark IV)
- Class designations (Explorer-class)

### Example Generated Names
- *ISV Tenacity*
- *The Quiet Axiom*
- *Outlier*
- *Nova Passage*
- *Cipher IX*
- *The Reverie*

## Recommendations for Our Ship

Given the research, names that fit our vibe:

### Top Candidates

| Name | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Bitship** | Simple, memorable, double meaning (vessel + shipping product) |
| **The Endeavour** | Classic, aspirational (but common) |
| **Axiom** | Self-evident truth — "it just works" |
| **Rocinante** | Dreamers on a quest (but taken/famous) |
| **Resolve** | Determination, commitment |
| **Manifest** | Making things real, shipping cargo |

### If Platform With Multiple Ships

Default names could be:
- User's name + random celestial: "JP's Nova"
- Procedural: "The [Adjective] [Noun]"
- Let users pick from curated list
- Or fully custom

---

## Conclusion

**Ships are named for what they seek or embody.**

We're building a place where humans and AI crew up to build things together. The name should capture:
- Collaboration (crew)
- Building/shipping (making things real)
- Journey (exploration, frontier)
- A bit of defiance (doing things differently)

**Bitship** still feels right to me — it's got the builder energy ("we ship things") and the vessel energy ("we're on this journey together").
