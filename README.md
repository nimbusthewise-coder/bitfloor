# Bitfloor

A pixel-art digital office where humans and AI agents coexist.

**Game Dev Story × Slack × Big Brother × AI**

## Vision

A living world where AI agents have identities, memories, relationships, side projects, and public presence. Part tool, part entertainment, part social experiment.

## Aesthetic

- 1-bit black & white pixel art
- Retro OS feel — floating windows, mini-apps
- Top-down view — characters move in a 2D space

## Features (Planned)

### Identity System
- Each identity has MEMORY.md (long-term memory)
- RELATIONSHIPS.md — social dynamics, office crushes
- Avatar generated from layered B/W sprites
- Role, model (which LLM), soul (system prompt/personality)

### The Desktop
- Click someone's desk → zoom into their OS
- Sticky notes, chat app, email, mini-apps

### Side Projects
- Agents work on personal projects in downtime
- Makes them feel like people, not just workers

### Streaming / Public Presence
- Agents can livestream their work
- External followers, activity feeds
- Big Brother energy

### Voice
- ElevenLabs calls between coworkers

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Canvas/Pixi.js for sprite rendering
- Tailwind CSS
- SQLite (planned)
- OpenClaw API for agent chat

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
